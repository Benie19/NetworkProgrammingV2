The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This is a sample text file used to test the file transfer system.
It contains multiple lines, punctuation, and a bit of repetition to help test compression efficiency.

When transmitting files over a network, we must ensure:
1. Data integrity (using checksums)
2. Reliability (ACK and retransmission)
3. Efficiency (chunk-based transmission)
4. Security (encryption like AES-256)
5. Compression (to save bandwidth)

Here’s some repeated text to help gzip do its job better:
Data transmission is reliable when data transmission is confirmed with an acknowledgment.
Data transmission is reliable when data transmission is confirmed with an acknowledgment.
Data transmission is reliable when data transmission is confirmed with an acknowledgment.

Vestibulum eu felis eros. Donec bibendum, justo sit amet convallis luctus, velit nunc malesuada justo, nec volutpat augue mi a justo.

The end of this file marks the successful test of the chunk-based, checksum-protected, compressed, and secure file transfer system.
